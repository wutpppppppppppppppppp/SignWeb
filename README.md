## Usage

This repository provides a two-pronged approach to advancing sign language translation:

### 1. Open-Source 3D Animation Models

Access a Collection of 3D Models: We offer a comprehensive library of 3D animation models optimized for sign language translation tasks. These models can be utilized for various applications, from research and development to creating educational or demonstration materials.
Contribute to the Model Library: We welcome contributions from the community to expand this valuable resource. If you've developed or have access to high-quality 3D models for sign language translation, please refer to the Contribution Guidelines section for details on how to submit them.
Integration with Your Project: The provided models are designed to be readily integrated into your sign language translation project.

### 2. 3D Motion Capture with Rokoko Studio

Capture High-Quality Sign Language Animations: This repository facilitates the capture of 3D motion data for sign language gestures using the Rokoko Studio app. By connecting your Rokoko suit with this setup, you can record precise movements that can be used to train or enhance sign language translation models.
Integration with Rokoko Studio: To leverage this functionality, ensure you have Rokoko Studio installed and configured. Detailed instructions on connecting Rokoko Studio with this repository will be provided in a separate document (link to be added when available).
