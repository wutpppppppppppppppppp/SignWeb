The services folder can hold complex business logic that isn't directly tied to a specific endpoint. This helps keep controllers clean and focused.

```JavaScript
// services/authService.js
const generateToken = (user) => {
    // Logic to generate a JWT token
};


module.exports = {
    generateToken,
};
```
